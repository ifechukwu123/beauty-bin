# Project Title

## Overview

What is your app? Give a brief description in a couple of sentences.

Beauty Bin is an app formulated to aid organizing and tracking makeup products.
It displays an online inventory of the products you own & notifies you when it's time to throw them out.

### Problem Space

Why is your app needed? Give any background information around any pain points or other reasons.
